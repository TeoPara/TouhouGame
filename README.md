### How to run  
You gotta open `bin/Release/net7.0/TouhouGame.exe`

### Controls
You move around with arrow keys, and you use Z to shoot. Holding down Shift lets you move more slowly, and shoot more narrowly.  
Enemies spawn gradually and randomly fly around while shooting circles of bullets.  
You have three lives. Getting hit clears all enemies and bullets off the screen.
